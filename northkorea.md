I've always listed North Korea as one of my top travel destinations. It's a pity that the country has remained closed after the COVID-19 pandemic. If they were to reopen, I would be among the first to go.

Many Chinese netizens are well aware of the brutal nature of the Kim dynasty’s regime. We often joke about it—“the Sun” memes, or references to the harsh conditions of daily life there. Some leftists, however, still try to defend North Korea, romanticizing its resistance to the West.

But I can’t help thinking about a deeper, more troubling truth:
My own government has consistently and deliberately supported the Kim regime, a regime responsible for crimes against humanity, simply to serve its geopolitical interests. From the Korean War to the Arduous March, and even now—China has always been there, backing them. Sometimes, I feel a sense of guilt about this. A kind of inherited complicity.

At the same time, I try to guard against the arrogance of viewing North Korea from a “strong country looking down on a weak one” perspective. I don’t want to approach North Korea with a sense of superiority, as if we’re freer or better. That kind of attitude dehumanizes its people all over again.

This is why I want to visit North Korea in person. Even if every itinerary is scripted, every view curated, I still want to feel the land, the air, the rhythm of life there. Maybe in the details—in the way people move, look, or even stay silent—I’ll find an answer. Or maybe I’ll just better understand the questions I’ve been asking myself all along.
